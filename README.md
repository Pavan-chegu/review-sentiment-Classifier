Overview
This project provides a novel approach to movie review sentiment analysis using a hybrid CNN+LSTM architecture. It uniquely addresses the use case of filtering movie reviews by sentiment to help users avoid negatively impacting their mental health when selecting movies.

Features
Combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for enhanced sentiment prediction accuracy.

Designed to classify movie reviews as positive or negative effectively.

Helps users identify movies with potentially harmful negative sentiment based on reviews, supporting better mental health choices.

Motivation
Often when looking for movies, people might unknowingly pick negatively reviewed movies, which could affect their mood. This project aims to provide a sentiment-based filter to allow users to make informed viewing decisions.
